### About me

I'm a second year at UW-Madison studying Computer Science and Math. I'm currently working to make Machine Learning in Mass Spectrometry more accessible at the Smith Research Group, and to finish up an ongoing project over at Epic Systems. This past summer, I also had the opportunity to contribute to OpenMS [doing some cmake and build systems work](https://gist.github.com/Avni2000/c6290cf500b5a87ee22b12ab8daa1dd0).

Apart from that, I've loved writing all my life, and am working on putting myself "out there", so to say, via a YouTube channel and a technical blog.

Thank you for visiting!

I'm currently absolutely obsessed with [MergeNB](https://github.com/Avni2000/MergeNB) - and I think it'll make it radically easier to use git with Juptyter Notebooks 

I'm an open book:
